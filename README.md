As a result, the team decided to hire a Full Stack developer who can develop an online banking web application with a rich and user-friendly interface.

Project development guidelines:

The project will be delivered within four sprints with every sprint delivering a minimal viable product.
It is mandatory to perform proper sprint planning with user stories to develop all the components of the project.
The learner can use any technology from the above-mentioned technologies for different layers of the project.
The web application should be responsive and should fetch or send data dynamically without hardcoded values.
The learner must maintain the version of the application over GitHub and every new change should be sent to the repository.
The learner must implement a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.
The learner should also deploy and host the application on an AWS EC2 instance.
The learner should also implement automation testing before the application enters the CI/CD pipeline.
The learner should use Git branching to separately perform the basic automation testing of application.
The learner should make a rich front-end of the application, which is user- friendly and easy for the user to navigate through the application.
There will be two portals in the application, namely the admin and user portal.
